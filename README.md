# Car_Selling_Price-prediction-
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars using Linear Regression. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, comprises various attributes of used cars such as the car's name, year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and ownership status. Our objective is to develop a robust model that accurately predicts the selling price based on these features. The approach involves data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. The repository includes a Jupyter notebook (car_price_prediction.ipynb), the dataset (dataset.csv). Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. Happy predicting!
